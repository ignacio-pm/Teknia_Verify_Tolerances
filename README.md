# Teknia_Verify_Tolerances

Project done during the internship at Teknia Manufacturing Group. The objective was to validate the tolerance of the measurements of a tool in OpenCV as a possible alternative to a more powerfool software application woth object recognition. In the notebook the distance between the centers of the circles is measured and could be compared to others in order to discard the tool if it did not pass the tolerance test. 

The date of the actual project is August 2019.
